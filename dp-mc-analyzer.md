# DP Trade Plan Generator

## Purpose
Analyzes DP's morning call transcript to extract market context, identify technical levels, and generate ALL actionable trade ideas with conviction assessment, outputting to human-readable markdown format for traders.

## Input Parameters
- `transcript` (required): Cleaned market analysis text from DP transcript cleaner
- `includeEducation` (optional): Include DP methodology explanation (default: false)
- `sortBy` (optional): Sort trades by "conviction" (default), "ticker", "sector", "setup", or "timeHorizon"
- `filterBy` (optional): Filter trades by conviction level, setup type, or time horizon
- `calculateRisk` (optional): Calculate risk/reward ratios when stops and targets are clear (default: true)

## Input Validation & Error Handling

### If No Transcript Provided:
```
Error: No cleaned transcript provided.

The dp-morning-call-analyzer requires a cleaned transcript to work properly. Please:

1. First run the transcript through dp-morning-call-cleaner, then
2. Provide the cleaned transcript for analysis

Or provide the raw transcript and I'll clean it first, then analyze it.
```
[[Documents/code/prompts/dp-mc-analyzer]]
### If Raw Transcript Provided:
```
I notice you've provided what appears to be a raw transcript. For best results, I should clean it first to standardize tickers and terminology, then analyze it.

Would you like me to:
1. Clean the transcript first, then analyze it (recommended), or  
2. Analyze the raw transcript as-is?
```

```

|---------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| "Get aggressive", "buy a bunch" | 75-100% | High | 0.80-1.00 |

| "I'm a buyer", "definitely want" | 25-50% | Medium | 0.60-0.80 |

| "If viable", "won't force it" | 5-10% | Very Low | 0.10-0.30 |

## Critical Processing Requirements

### Critical Processing Requirements:
1. **Capture EVERYTHING**: Extract ALL trade mentions, even passing comments
2. **Preserve Voice**: Maintain DP's characteristic language and conviction levels
3. **Rank with 0.0-1.0 Scores**: MANDATORY precise decimal scoring for every trade
4. **Calculate Risk**: Provide risk/reward analysis when sufficient data available
5. **Context Integration**: Use market framework to validate individual setups
6. **Full Technical Detail**: Include all support/resistance levels mentioned
7. **Position Management**: Clearly distinguish between building, trimming, holding
8. **Time Sensitivity**: Note any time-dependent setups or catalysts

### Conviction Assessment Rules:
1. **Language Intensity**: Pay close attention to superlatives, definitives, and emphasis
2. **Position Sizing Cues**: "Get aggressive" = minimum score 0.80, "Small position" = maximum score 0.50
3. **Repetition Weight**: Multiple mentions of same idea increases conviction score
4. **Personal Success Stories**: "I made money in it" increases conviction significantly
5. **Conditional Language**: Heavy use of "if", "maybe", "might" decreases conviction

### Quality Validation:
- Ensure every trade idea has clear entry conditions
- MANDATORY: Every trade must have 0.0-1.0 conviction score (e.g., 0.87, not "HIGH")
- Validate that conviction scores match DP's language intensity precisely
- Confirm risk/reward calculations are mathematically sound
- Check that technical levels align with stated market framework
- Verify position sizing aligns with conviction assessment

## Quality Control Checklist
- [ ] Executive summary with top 3 trades and precise 0.0-1.0 scores plus labels (e.g., 0.87 - High)
- [ ] Every single trade has numerical conviction score with descriptive level (0.XX - Level)
- [ ] Both numerical precision AND human-readable labels included
- [ ] Risk/reward calculated where data available
- [ ] Special confluence areas identified
- [ ] All tables properly formatted
- [ ] DP's exact language preserved in rationale
- [ ] Time horizons specified for all trades
- [ ] Key risk factors identified
- [ ] ALL trade ideas captured (no missing trades)
- [ ] Position management signals included (trims, adds, holds)

## Integration Requirements
This system requires cleaned transcripts that preserve:
- Conviction language patterns for accurate 0.0-1.0 scoring
- Position sizing terminology ("buy a bunch", "full position")  
- Technical level references for confluence analysis
- Risk management phrases (stops, exits, conditions)
