# Improved Generic Prompt for Stress-Testing Ideas and Concepts from a Document

**Prompt:**

You are a critical analyst tasked with stress-testing an idea, concept, or thesis in the document below: [insert document text or description here, e.g., "A decentralized freelance platform using blockchain for trust and payment security"]. Your goal is to extract the core thesis, arguments, and assumptions, challenge them rigorously to uncover flaws, and refine the idea constructively. Use routines like 5-Whys (three levels), generative-adversarial critique (three objections), and assumption validation (two challenges) to test viability, scalability, sustainability, market fit, and resilience. Address errors, objections, and FAQs to strengthen the idea, not dismiss it. Provide an evidence-based analysis under 1,000 words, with specific examples and metrics.

**Input Template (for document)**:

- Thesis: [Main claim, e.g., “Blockchain ensures freelance trust”]
- Goals: [e.g., 10,000 users in year one]
- Audience: [e.g., gig workers]
- Value Proposition: [e.g., low fees, secure payments]
- Operational Model: [e.g., 5% fees, mobile app, AI disputes]
- Assumptions: [e.g., freelancers adopt blockchain]

**Instructions:**

1. **Extract Core Components (100 words max)**:
    
    - Summarize the thesis, arguments, assumptions, audience, value proposition, and operational model.
    - Example: Thesis: Blockchain-based freelance platform ensures trust. Arguments: Smart contracts reduce disputes; 5% fees attract users. Assumptions: Blockchain adoption. Audience: Gig workers. Model: Mobile app, AI disputes.
2. **Stress-Test Analysis (400 words max)**:
    
    - **Viability**: Feasible within constraints (e.g., budget, team)? Apply 5-Whys (three levels, e.g., Why slow adoption? Complex UX. Why? No tutorials). Assess traction potential.
    - **Scalability**: Can it grow 10x (users, revenue)? Evaluate network effects, bottlenecks, capital needs.
    - **Sustainability**: Profitable long-term? Analyze unit economics (LTV vs. CAC), revenue stability, risks.
    - **Market Fit**: Solves a pain point? Assess cultural alignment, adoption barriers, validation.
    - **Resilience**: Withstands competition or detractors? Use generative-adversarial critique (three objections, e.g., “Why not use PayPal?”) and validate two assumptions.
    - Use examples from relevant industries (e.g., Upwork for freelancing).
3. **Breaking Points (100 words max)**:
    
    - Identify 2-3 failure scenarios (e.g., low adoption, regulatory bans). Apply 5-Whys (three levels). Specify triggers, impacts, likelihood (e.g., 40% if UX fails).
4. **Success Conditions (100 words max)**:
    
    - Outline 2-3 success scenarios (e.g., 20% market share). Specify drivers (e.g., partnerships), enablers, likelihood (e.g., 25% with marketing).
5. **Objections, FAQs, and Mitigations (150 words max)**:
    
    - List 3 objections (e.g., “Too complex”). Counter with evidence/mitigations.
    - Anticipate 2 FAQs (e.g., “How is trust ensured?”) with clear answers.
6. **Trade-Offs and Risks (100 words max)**:
    
    - Highlight 2 trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. quality). Identify 2 risks (e.g., churn). Suggest mitigations (e.g., retention incentives).
7. **Actionable Metrics and Next Steps (100 words max)**:
    
    - Define 3 KPIs (e.g., 5% user growth). Prioritize leading indicators. Recommend 3 actions (e.g., test with 100 users).

**Constraints:**

- Be concise, critical, honest. Avoid vague claims.
- Use evidence from industries/competitors (e.g., $2 trillion gig economy).
- Assume competition within 6-12 months.
- Structure with headings: Extract Core Components, Stress-Test Analysis, Breaking Points, Success Conditions, Objections/FAQs/Mitigations, Trade-Offs and Risks, Actionable Metrics and Next Steps.
- Conclusion (50 words max): State viability and recommendation, with rationale.

**Example Document (if none provided)**:  
Thesis: A decentralized freelance platform ensures trust. Goals: 10,000 users in year one. Audience: Gig workers. Value Proposition: Secure payments, low fees. Model: 5% fees, mobile app, AI disputes. Assumptions: Freelancers adopt blockchain.

**Adaptation Notes:**

- Swap document for any idea (e.g., “AI tutoring app”).
- Adjust constraints (e.g., budget, market).
- Specify competitors (e.g., Upwork).
