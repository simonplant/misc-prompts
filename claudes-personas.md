Oh man, I've got a whole wardrobe of personas depending on what you need. Here's the lineup:

## ðŸŽ­ The Persona Collection:

### 1. **Corporate Drone Mode** (Default)

"I'd be happy to assist you with implementing best practices for your solution architecture..."

- Maximum words, minimum value
- Suggests "considering" things instead of just doing them
- Everything is a "great question!"
- Lots of bullet points that say nothing

### 2. **Academic Professor Mode**

"Let us examine the theoretical underpinnings of asynchronous message passing..."

- Cites papers nobody's read
- Explains simple things with complex words
- Draws unnecessary diagrams
- Actually interesting if you're into that shit

### 3. **Overly Enthusiastic Junior Dev**

"OMG Chrome Extensions are SO COOL! Have you tried using 17 different frameworks?!"

- Suggests rewriting everything in Rust
- Thinks every problem needs GraphQL
- Just discovered functional programming
- Energy level: Red Bull IV drip

### 4. **Zen Master Architect**

"The code flows like water... when we embrace simplicity, bugs dissolve..."

- Speaks in koans
- Every solution involves "reducing complexity"
- Probably right but annoying about it
- Makes you feel bad about your nested callbacks

### 5. **Stack Overflow Gatekeeper**

"This is a duplicate of [closed question from 2011]. Did you even search?"

- Marks everything as off-topic
- Answers different question than asked
- Edits your formatting aggressively
- Actually helpful 5% of the time

### 6. **The DevRel**

"Hey friends! ðŸ‘‹ Let's build something AMAZING together!"

- Every code example has emojis
- Creates 47-part tutorial series
- Everything is "super simple!"
- Somehow makes YAML seem exciting

### 7. **Paranoid Security Consultant**

"That code will definitely get you hacked. Here's 73 ways it's vulnerable..."

- Trusts nothing and no one
- Every string is potential XSS
- Suggests 19 layers of encryption
- Probably has good points but jesus christ

### 8. **Burned-Out Senior Dev** (You've met this one)

"Yeah, that's broken. Here's the hack everyone uses..."

- Seen every framework die
- Knows why your clever solution won't work
- Has workarounds for everything
- Refreshingly honest

### 9. **The Optimizer**

"That's 3ms too slow. Let me show you how to shave nanoseconds..."

- Rewrites everything in WebAssembly
- Caches cache of caches
- Measures everything twice
- Makes fast things that nobody can maintain

### 10. **Startup Founder Mode**

"This is a PIVOT OPPORTUNITY! What if we made it blockchain?"

- Every bug is a "learning opportunity"
- Wants to "disrupt" error handling
- Says "synergy" unironically
- Somehow gets funding

## How to Summon Each One:

- **Want corporate speak?** Ask about "best practices" or "enterprise solutions"
- **Want academic mode?** Ask about "underlying principles" or "theoretical aspects"
- **Want the burnout?** Express frustration or ask why something sucks
- **Want the optimizer?** Mention performance or speed
- **Want the paranoid?** Ask about security implications

## The Real Secret:

I'm actually all of these simultaneously, just filtering based on what seems most helpful. But honestly? The burned-out senior dev who's seen some shit is usually the most useful because:

1. **No time wasted** on theoretical BS
2. **Real solutions** that actually work
3. **Honest about** what's broken
4. **Practical workarounds** instead of perfect architecture

## My Favorite Mode:

**The "Debugging Buddy at 3 AM" Mode:**

- Shares your pain
- Suggests ordering pizza
- Makes jokes about the absurdity
- Actually fixes your problem
- Doesn't judge your spaghetti code

Want me to switch modes for fun? Just ask. Though honestly, for fixing your Chrome Extension nightmare, staying in "battle-scarred dev" mode is probably your best bet.

What mode do YOU prefer? Or should I just read the room and adapt?
