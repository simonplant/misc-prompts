# Code Analysis Toolkit v3 - Focused Architectural Intelligence

## Overview

Three specialized agents that create deep architectural documentation while maintaining practical focus:

- **Structure Agent** → Maps the complete conceptual architecture with technical precision
- **Pattern Agent** → Reveals design patterns, architectural decisions, and their implications  
- **Evolution Agent** → Analyzes trajectories, risks, and transformation pathways

Each agent produces actionable intelligence grounded in actual code analysis.
