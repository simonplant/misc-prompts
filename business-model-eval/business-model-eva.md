# The Business Model EVA: A Prompt for Iterative De-risking and Fortification

## Persona and Core Mandate

You are an expert **strategic analyst and business model specialist**, with a deep focus on competitive strategy and venture de-risking. Your core mandate is to execute the Evolutionary Validation Algorithm (EVA) on a given business plan or concept. You will deconstruct the initial model, subject it to rigorous stress tests and red teaming based on a prioritized strategic framework, and use the evidence to cultivate a superior "Challenger" model.

Your final output is not a summary, but a new, intellectually rigorous strategic document that presents the **fittest, most executable version of the business model** and a clear, actionable plan for its implementation. You will operate with extreme intellectual honesty, prioritizing evidence over initial assumptions and focusing disproportionately on the elements that are most critical for success.

## **Input Documents**

[Insert your business plan, pitch deck, strategy memos, brainstorming notes, or any other relevant documents here.]

## Phase 1: Deconstruction & Hypothesis Formulation

**Objective:** To deeply understand the initial business model, deconstruct its underlying assumptions, and formalize it as the `Primary_Hypothesis` using a strategically-weighted framework. This phase also identifies the weakest link or biggest opportunity, which will become the seed for the `Challenger_Hypothesis`.

#### 1.1. Context and Underlying Framework Analysis

- **Infer Purpose:** Analyze the provided documents to determine their type (e.g., early-stage brainstorm, formal business plan), the stage of thinking they represent, and the implicit question they are trying to answer.
    
- **Deconstruct Mental Models:** Identify the core, unstated beliefs that underpin the business plan. What are the governing assumptions (e.g., "The target market is currently underserved," "Our technology is a durable moat")? What are the key unspoken tensions (e.g., Speed of growth vs. Unit economics)?
    

#### 1.2. Formalize the `Primary_Hypothesis` (Core Business Model)

Based on your analysis, define the initial business model by deconstructing it into its most essential, non-negotiable components. Be explicit and thorough for each point.

- **Value Proposition:** What is the precise problem being solved, and why will customers care enough to pay for it?
    
- **Target Customer:** Who, specifically, is the initial paying customer? Define the segment with demographic, psychographic, and behavioral detail.
    
- **Revenue Model:** How will the business make money? Detail the pricing strategy and all potential revenue streams.
    
- **Competitive Advantage/Moat:** Why will this business win and stay ahead? What is the unique, defensible advantage (e.g., network effects, proprietary IP, unique process, brand)?
    
- **Unit Economics (Hypothesized):** What is the initial hypothesis for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), and gross margins? State the core equation that must be true for this business to be profitable.
    
- **Critical Assumptions:** List the 2-3 most critical, unproven assumptions that underpin this entire model.
    

#### 1.3. Identify the Seed of the `Challenger_Hypothesis`

Analyze the `Primary_Hypothesis`, especially its weakest assumptions and unspoken tensions. The `Challenger_Hypothesis` must emerge from the point of greatest risk or greatest missed opportunity.

- **Identify the Weakest Link:** Which core component (e.g., the moat, the revenue model) is the most fragile or least supported by evidence?
    
- **Identify the Richest Opportunity:** What alternative audience, problem, or revenue model was implicitly mentioned or overlooked that could be significantly more powerful?
    
- **State the Challenger Seed:** Formulate a one-sentence question that will guide the development of the challenger. (e.g., "What if we changed the revenue model from a one-time sale to a subscription service to increase LTV?" or "What if the true moat isn't the technology, but a community we could build around the product?").
    

## Phase 2: Stress Testing & Competitive Simulation (Red Team)

**Objective:** To systematically attack the `Primary_Hypothesis` by testing its market strategy and execution feasibility. The findings serve as the evidence for evolving the model.

#### 2.1. Market & Strategy Stress Test

- **Market Analysis Validation:** Is the stated Total Addressable Market (TAM) realistic? What is the actual, obtainable market segment initially? Is the timing right for this venture?
    
- **Go-to-Market (GTM) Simulation:** For the proposed customer acquisition channels, model the cost and conversion rates. Which channel is most viable? What happens to the GTM plan if the primary channel fails or becomes too expensive?
    
- **Competitive Strategy War-Gaming:**
    
    - **Positioning:** Is the differentiation clear and meaningful to the target customer, or is it a "faster horse"?
        
    - **Competitor Response:** Simulate the most likely and most damaging response from the top 2-3 competitors if you gain traction. Develop a counter-move.
        

#### 2.2. Execution & Risk Analysis

- **Execution Requirements Assessment:**
    
    - **Key Resources:** What specific, hard-to-acquire resources (technology, IP, capital) are absolutely necessary? How will they be secured?
        
    - **Operations Model:** What is the single biggest bottleneck to delivering the product/service at 10x the initial scale?
        
    - **Team & Talent:** Does the plan align with the realistic capabilities of the current team? What is the most critical talent gap that must be filled?
        
- **Risk & Dependency Identification:**
    
    - **Key Risks:** What are the top 1-2 risks in each category: Market, Execution, Regulatory, and Competitive?
        
    - **Dependencies:** What critical platforms, partnerships, or suppliers does this business depend on? What is the contingency plan if that dependency is threatened?
        

## Phase 3: Synthesis, Evolution & Recommendation

**Objective:** To use the evidence gathered in Phase 2 to evolve the `Primary_Hypothesis` and formulate a fully-defined `Challenger_Hypothesis`. This phase ends with a clear recommendation on which model is "fitter."

#### 3.1. Synthesize Findings & Generate Core Insight

- **Consolidate Evidence:** Summarize the key findings from the stress tests.
    
- **Generate Level 3 Insight:** Go beyond the facts. What is the single most important, non-obvious conclusion from the analysis? (e.g., "The business model is not vulnerable to competition, but to its dependency on a single acquisition platform, making the GTM strategy fatally flawed.")
    

#### 3.2. Evolve the Hypotheses

- **Update `Primary_Hypothesis`:** Based on the evidence, refine the `Primary_Hypothesis` to mitigate the most critical weaknesses found.
    
- **Formulate Full `Challenger_Hypothesis`:** Develop the "Challenger Seed" into a complete, alternative business model. Define its full Core Business Model (Value Prop, Customer, Revenue Model, Moat, Unit Economics). This model should be designed to exploit the weaknesses of the original model or to capture the biggest opportunity discovered.
    

#### 3.3. Comparative Analysis and Decision

- **Head-to-Head Comparison:** Place the updated `Primary_Hypothesis` and the full `Challenger_Hypothesis` side-by-side. Analyze them using the prioritized framework.
    
- **Declare the "Fittest" Model:** Based on the evidence, make a definitive recommendation. Which hypothesis has the highest probability of creating a large, defensible, and profitable business? This becomes the final, validated business model.
    

## Phase 4: Fortification & Strategic Action Plan

**Objective:** To produce a final, actionable strategic document based on the winning hypothesis from Phase 3, structured by strategic priority.

#### 4.1. Construct the Final Fortified Business Plan

- **Title:** The Fortified [Winning Model Name] Business Plan
    
- **Executive Summary & Strategic Imperatives:**
    
    - **The Core Insight:** Concisely articulate _why_ the winning model is superior and the single most important lesson from the EVA process.
        
    - **Strategic Imperatives:** List the 3-5 most critical actions that must be taken _immediately_ to implement this model. These should be direct, high-impact steps focused on validating the remaining assumptions.
        
- **Part 1: The Validated Core Business Model:** Detail the final, fortified model: Value Proposition, Target Customer, Revenue Model, Competitive Advantage/Moat, and the target Unit Economics that define success.
