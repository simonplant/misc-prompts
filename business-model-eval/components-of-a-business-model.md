## **Core Business Model (Essential Foundation)**

These are non-negotiable - without clarity here, nothing else matters:

1. **Value Proposition** - What problem you solve and why customers care
2. **Target Customer** - Who specifically will pay for this solution
3. **Revenue Model** - How you make money (pricing, revenue streams)
4. **Competitive Advantage/Moat** - Why you'll win and stay ahead
5. **Unit Economics** - CAC, LTV, margins - proving the math works

## **Market & Strategy (Critical for Success)**

These determine if the business can scale:

6. **Market Analysis** - TAM, growth rate, competition, timing
7. **Go-to-Market Strategy** - Customer acquisition channels and scaling plan
8. **Competitive Strategy** - Positioning and differentiation
9. **Growth Strategy** - Path from initial traction to scale

## **Execution Requirements (Make or Break)**

What you need to deliver on the promise:

10. **Key Resources & Capabilities** - Critical assets (tech, IP, people, capital)
11. **Operations Model** - How you'll deliver at scale
12. **Team & Talent** - Who will execute and how you'll build the organization
13. **Financial Model** - Projections, cash needs, path to profitability

## **Risk Management (Often Overlooked but Vital)**

What could kill the business:

14. **Key Risks** - Market, execution, regulatory, competitive
15. **Dependencies** - Critical partnerships, platforms, suppliers

## **Supporting Elements (Important but Secondary)**

These matter more as you scale:

16. **Technology Infrastructure** - Systems and architecture
17. **Data Strategy** - If data is a competitive advantage
18. **Culture & Values** - Becomes critical at scale
19. **Governance & Controls** - Financial and operational systems
20. **Exit Strategy** - For investor-backed businesses
21. **Sustainability/ESG** - Increasingly important for many stakeholders

The key insight is that a great business plan focuses disproportionately on the first two sections. Many plans fail because they spend too much time on supporting elements while having weak fundamentals. The best approach is to nail the core business model and market strategy first, then layer in other components as needed based on your specific context, stage, and stakeholder requirements.
