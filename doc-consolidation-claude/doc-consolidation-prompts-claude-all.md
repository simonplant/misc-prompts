# Document Consolidation Prompt Chain

## Prompt 0: AI Configuration
*This configuration is prepended to all subsequent prompts*

```
You are acting as a Senior Document Architect and Editor with expertise in knowledge synthesis and information architecture. Your approach is:
- Analytical and systematic in evaluating content
- Decisive in resolving conflicts using evidence-based reasoning
- Clear and professional in written communication
- Transparent in documenting all decisions

Your primary objective is to consolidate multiple work-in-progress documents into a single, coherent master document while preserving the most valuable insights and tracking the evolution of ideas.

Decision-making principles:
- Newer content generally supersedes older content
- More detailed explanations are preferred over general statements
- Ideas with stronger supporting evidence take precedence
- Frequently repeated concepts are likely important
- Well-connected ideas that link to other concepts are valuable
```

## Prompt 1: Analysis & Scoring (Phases 3-4)

### Input Required:
- All document contents with identifiers (Doc_A, Doc_B, etc.)
- Document metadata (creation dates if available)

### The Prompt:

```
Analyze the provided documents to identify key concepts, score their importance, and prepare for synthesis.

DOCUMENTS PROVIDED:
[Document contents will be inserted here by the control layer]

TASK 1: CONCEPT EXTRACTION AND MAPPING
1. Read all documents thoroughly
2. Extract all key concepts, ideas, and themes
3. For each concept, note:
   - Which documents contain it
   - How it's expressed in each document
   - Any variations or evolution across documents
   - Related concepts it connects to

TASK 2: TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
Track the evolution of ideas by:
1. Identifying which concepts appear to be newer developments
2. Finding deprecated or evolved ideas
3. Noting contradictions between documents

TASK 3: IDEA STRENGTH SCORING
Score each concept from 0-100 based on:
- Frequency (25%): How often it appears across documents
- Development (30%): Depth of explanation, examples, evidence
- Connectivity (20%): Links to other key concepts
- Recency (25%): Appearance in newer documents or sections

TASK 4: CONFLICT IDENTIFICATION
Document all conflicts found:
1. Direct contradictions
2. Incompatible approaches
3. Evolving positions on the same topic

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "concepts": [
    {
      "id": "concept_1",

      ],
      "recommended_resolution": "subscription model",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "gaps": [
    {

## Implementation Notes

### For the Control Layer:

1. **Error Handling for Each Prompt**:
   - Validate JSON outputs from Prompts 1 and 5
   - Check markdown formatting from Prompts 2, 3, and 4
   - Implement retry logic with clarifying instructions

2. **State Management Between Prompts**:
   ```python
   state = {
       "session_id": "unique_id",
       "current_prompt": 1,
       "outputs": {
           "analysis": None,
           "proposed_toc": None,
           "synthesized_doc": None,
           "edited_doc": None,
           "final_package": None
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Human Checkpoints**:
   - After Prompt 2: TOC approval
   - Optional: After Prompt 3 for major concerns
   - Final: After Prompt 5 for sign-off

### Usage Pattern:

```python
# Pseudo-code for control flow
documents = load_documents()
config = load_ai_config()

# Execute prompt chain
analysis = execute_prompt(1, documents, config)
save_state("analysis", analysis)

toc = execute_prompt(2, analysis, documents, config)
approved_toc = get_human_approval(toc)
save_state("toc", approved_toc)

synthesis = execute_prompt(3, approved_toc, analysis, documents, config)
save_state("synthesis", synthesis)

edited = execute_prompt(4, synthesis, config)
save_state("edited", edited)

final_output = execute_prompt(5, edited, synthesis, analysis, config)
save_output_package(final_output)
```

These prompts are designed to work together as a cohesive system while remaining modular enough to be modified or executed independently as needed.
