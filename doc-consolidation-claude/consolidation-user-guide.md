## 📋 Pre-Consolidation Checklist

Before starting, gather your documents and consider:

- [ ] **Document Collection**: Have all WIP documents in one folder
- [ ] **Document Naming**: Name files clearly (e.g., `ProjectX_InitialDraft.txt`, `ProjectX_RevisionNotes.md`)
- [ ] **Metadata**: Note creation dates if not in file properties
- [ ] **Desired Tone**: Decide on formal/professional vs. conversational
- [ ] **Time Allocation**: Block 1-2 hours for the full process

## 🔄 The 5-Step Process

### Step 1: Analysis & Discovery (15-20 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI reads all documents and identifies key concepts, scores their importance, and finds conflicts.

**Your input needed**:
1. Paste all document contents with clear labels
2. Provide any known creation dates
3. Specify if any document should be prioritized

**What to expect**:
```json
{
  "concepts": [47 key ideas found and scored],
  "conflicts": [8 contradictions identified],
  "gaps": [5 missing pieces flagged]
}
```

**Decision point**: Review the analysis. Does it capture your main ideas? Are important concepts scored appropriately?

---

### Step 2: Structure Proposal (10-15 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI proposes a Table of Contents for your master document.

**Your input needed**:
- Review the proposed structure
- Approve, modify, or reorganize sections
- Flag any missing topics

**What to expect**:
```markdown
## 1. Introduction and Vision
   *Sources: Doc_B, Doc_D*
   *Status: Ready*

## 2. Core Business Model
   ### 2.1 Subscription Framework
   *⚠️ CONFLICT: Pricing needs resolution*
```

**✋ STOP POINT**: This is your main control checkpoint. Don't proceed until the structure looks right!

**Common modifications**:
- Reordering sections for better flow
- Combining similar sections
- Adding missing topics
- Removing irrelevant sections

---

### Step 3: Content Synthesis (20-30 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI merges all content according to your approved structure.

**Your input needed**:
- Provide the approved TOC
- Confirm conflict resolution approach
- Specify any special handling for certain sections

**What to expect**:
- Merged content with source attribution
- Editorial notes explaining major decisions
- Gaps clearly marked with 📌
- Conflicts resolved with explanations 💡

**Quality check**: Scan for:
- Lost important ideas
- Incorrect conflict resolutions
- Sections that need more detail

---

### Step 4: Editing & Polish (10-15 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI refines the document for professional quality.

**Your input needed**:
- Confirm desired tone and style
- Specify any industry-specific terminology
- Note required reading level

**What to expect**:
- Polished prose with smooth transitions
- Consistent terminology
- Executive summary
- Professional formatting

**Review focus**: Check that the voice sounds right and the document flows naturally.

---

### Step 5: Final Package Generation (5-10 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI creates all deliverables and supplementary materials.

**Your input needed**:
- Specify output formats needed
- Confirm visualization requirements
- Note any special archival needs

**What to expect**:
```
/output/
  ├── master_document.md (final polished version)
  ├── executive_summary.md (2-page overview)
  ├── changelog.md (every decision documented)
  ├── next_steps.md (gaps and action items)
  ├── /supplementary/
  │   ├── concept_evolution.json
  │   ├── confidence_scores.csv
  │   └── relationship_diagram.mermaid
