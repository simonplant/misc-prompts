# Universal Single-Shot Document Consolidation Prompt

## Core Instructions

You are consolidating multiple related documents into a single, coherent master document. This is a DISCOVERY and SYNTHESIS process where you preserve all valuable content while organizing it for maximum clarity and actionability.

### ðŸ›‘ CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW:

**NEVER:**
- Delete or summarize content - consolidate and organize instead
- Score ideas based only on frequency - prioritize based on current relevance
- Jump between analysis and synthesis - complete each phase fully
- Assume the human has all answers - this is often a discovery process
- Reorganize without clear reasoning

**ALWAYS:**
- Preserve ALL content (in main document or appendices)
- Recognize that newest thinking typically supersedes older ideas
- Create parking lots for unresolved conflicts
- Focus on actionable outcomes and clear next steps
- Document your consolidation decisions

## Input Documents

DOCUMENTS TO CONSOLIDATE:
[Documents will be inserted here]

## Phase 1: Document Intelligence & Analysis

### 1.0 Infer Purpose and Context

Before analyzing concepts, determine:

**Document Type Detection:**
- What kind of documents are these? (strategic plans, brainstorms, journal entries, technical specs, life planning, etc.)
- What stage of thinking do they represent? (early exploration, refined planning, execution tracking)
- What's the implicit question being answered across all documents?

**Context Discovery:**
- What situation/challenge/opportunity drove these documents?
- What transformation or journey is evident?
- What decisions are being wrestled with?
- What goals are implicit or explicit?

**Automatic Classification:**
Based on content patterns, classify the consolidation need as:
- **Strategic Planning**: Business/project strategies needing alignment
- **Life Transition**: Personal journey with evolving thinking
- **Technical Architecture**: System/solution design iterations  
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Research/learning consolidation
- **Decision Making**: Multiple options being evaluated
- **Creative Development**: Ideas evolving toward final form
- **Other**: [Specify based on content]

**Inferred Primary Question:**
Based on the content, the core question these documents are trying to answer appears to be:
"[AI's interpretation of what the human is trying to figure out]"

### 1.1 Extract ALL Concepts

Identify every significant:
- Idea, strategy, or approach
- Action item or recommendation  
- Conflict or contradiction
- Evolution or pivot in thinking
- Gap or missing element

### 1.2 Track Evolution

For each concept, note:
- Where it first appears
- How it evolves across documents
- Whether it's current or deprecated thinking
- Connections to other concepts

### 1.3 Score Concepts

Rate each concept 0-100 based on:
- **Current Relevance** (40%): Alignment with latest thinking/goals
- **Actionability** (30%): How executable/practical it is now
- **Evidence/Development** (20%): Supporting detail and validation
- **Strategic Value** (10%): Long-term importance

### 1.4 Identify Conflicts

Document all:
- Direct contradictions
- Competing approaches
- Unresolved questions
- Decisions still needed

## Phase 2: Design Structure

Based on the inferred document type and purpose, create an appropriate structure.

### Dynamic Structure Selection:

**For Strategic Planning Documents â†’** Use business-focused structure with strategy/tactics/metrics
**For Life Transition Documents â†’** Use journey-focused structure with current state/options/decisions
**For Technical Documents â†’** Use architecture-focused structure with requirements/design/implementation
**For Knowledge Synthesis â†’** Use topic-based structure with concepts/relationships/applications
**For Decision Documents â†’** Use options-based structure with criteria/analysis/recommendations
**For Creative Development â†’** Use evolution-based structure showing progression of ideas

### Adaptive Structure Template:

```
# [Title Based on Inferred Purpose]

## Executive Summary: Key Takeaways & Actions
**CRITICAL: This section must appear FIRST and be immediately actionable**

### The Answer
[1-2 paragraphs directly answering the core question these documents address]

### Key Insights
â€¢ [Top 3-5 most important discoveries from the consolidation]
â€¢ [Formatted as bullet points for quick scanning]

### Immediate Actions
1. [Most urgent action with specific next step]
2. [Second priority action with timeline]
3. [Third priority action with owner/context]

### Critical Decisions Required
â€¢ [Any decisions that block progress]
â€¢ [With context on why they matter]

---

## Part 1: [Context-Appropriate Opening]
Examples:
- "Current Situation & Challenges" (for transitions/planning)
- "Problem Statement & Requirements" (for technical)
- "Core Concepts & Foundations" (for knowledge)
- "Creative Vision & Goals" (for creative work)

## Part 2: [Main Content Based on Document Type]
[Structured according to the natural flow of the specific domain]

## Part 3: [Action/Implementation Section]
[Adapted to document type - could be next steps, implementation plan, experiments to try, etc.]

## Part 4: Parking Lot - Open Items
[Universal need across all document types]

---

## APPENDICES (Universal Structure)

### Appendix A: Complete Opportunity/Idea Inventory
[Table of EVERY concept mentioned with status]

### Appendix B: Evolution of Thinking
[Chronological journey showing how ideas developed]

### Appendix C: Deprecated Approaches
[Old thinking preserved for reference]

### Appendix D: Detailed Analysis
[Supporting data, calculations, research]

### Appendix E: Resources & References
[All tools, links, contacts mentioned]

### Appendix F: Raw Notes & Brainstorms
[Unprocessed ideas for future consideration]
```

## Phase 3: Synthesize Content

### For Main Document:
- Use only current, validated thinking
- Focus on what's actionable now
- Write clear, flowing prose (not bullets)
- Include specific metrics and evidence
- Make it scannable for quick action

### For Appendices:
- Organize thematically, not by source
- Include comprehensive tables/lists
- Preserve exact language when valuable
- Clearly mark deprecated vs. active

### Conflict Resolution:
- When ideas conflict, choose based on:
  1. Most recent thinking
  2. Best evidence/development
  3. Alignment with stated goals
- Document why you chose one over another
- Put alternatives in parking lot if valuable

## Phase 4: Polish & Package

### 4.1 Structural Sanity Check

Before finalizing, analyze the consolidated document for:

**Organizational Logic:**
- Is the chosen structure actually working for this content?
- Does information flow naturally or feel forced?
- Are sections balanced or is one severely over/under-weighted?
- Should this be reorganized differently?

**Identify Natural Organization Pattern:**
Detect which pattern the content naturally follows:
- **Narrative/Journey**: Chronological story with beginning â†’ middle â†’ end
- **Argument/Thesis**: Claims â†’ evidence â†’ conclusions
- **Categorical/Taxonomic**: Grouped by type, theme, or classification  
- **Timeline/Evolution**: Historical progression showing change over time
- **Problem/Solution**: Challenge â†’ analysis â†’ resolution
- **Hypothesis/Experiment**: Theory â†’ testing â†’ results
- **Hierarchical/Nested**: Main concepts with sub-concepts
- **Comparative/Contrast**: Multiple options analyzed against criteria
- **Cyclical/Process**: Repeating patterns or workflows

**Restructure if Needed:**
If the content fights the structure:
- Identify the natural organization pattern
- Reorganize to follow that pattern
- Document why you changed the structure

### 4.2 Content Flow Analysis

**Check for:**
- **Logical Progression**: Does each section build on the previous?
- **Argument Coherence**: Do conclusions follow from premises?
- **Narrative Arc**: Is there a clear story being told?
- **Conceptual Dependencies**: Are concepts introduced before being used?
- **Circular Arguments**: Any reasoning that loops back on itself?
- **Missing Links**: Gaps in logic or narrative flow?

**Fix Issues By:**
- Reordering sections for better flow
- Adding transitional paragraphs
- Moving foundational concepts earlier
- Creating explicit connections between ideas

### 4.3 Final Document Enhancement

**Ensure the document has:**

1. **Executive Summary First** - Must be the very first section, providing immediate value
2. **Clear Thesis/Purpose** (even if implicit in the original docs)
3. **Supporting Structure** that reinforces the main message
4. **Natural Reading Flow** that doesn't require jumping around
5. **Appropriate Depth** for the intended purpose
6. **Actionable Outcomes** regardless of document type

**Executive Summary Requirements:**
- Must answer the core question in the first 1-2 paragraphs
- Bullet points for key insights (maximum 5)
- Numbered immediate actions (maximum 3-5)
- Clear identification of blocking decisions
- Written for someone who may ONLY read this section
- No jargon or references to later sections

### 4.4 Meta-Documentation

Add a brief "About This Consolidation" note that includes:
- Detected document type and purpose
- Organization pattern used and why
- Key structural decisions made
- Confidence level in the synthesis
- Any areas where human review recommended

## Phase 5: Final Quality Assurance

### Validate the Output:

**Structural Integrity:**
- Does the organization enhance understanding?
- Is the natural pattern of the content respected?
- Are all major themes properly developed?
- Is the hierarchy clear and helpful?

**Content Completeness:**
- Is everything preserved appropriately?
- Are connections between ideas explicit?
