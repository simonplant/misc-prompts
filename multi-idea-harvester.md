# The Conceptual Field Harvester: Extracting Pure Ideas from Document Clusters

This protocol treats a collection of documents as a **conceptual field** - a multi-dimensional space where ideas exist at various levels of abstraction, expression, and interconnection. The goal is to extract the pure conceptual structures that underlie surface-level expressions, revealing the "thoughts inside the brains" across all documents.

## Core Objective

To achieve **Conceptual Field Clarity** - a complete mapping of the idea-space contained within multiple documents, stripped of redundant expression and normalized to reveal the essential conceptual skeleton.

## Confidence Scoring Framework

Throughout this protocol, apply 0-1 confidence scores to every extraction, relationship, and synthesis:

**Extraction Confidence (EC)**: How certain are we this is a distinct idea?
- 1.0 = Explicitly stated, unambiguous
- 0.7-0.9 = Clearly implied, minor interpretation needed  
- 0.4-0.6 = Requires significant inference
- 0.1-0.3 = Highly speculative extraction

**Relationship Confidence (RC)**: How certain are we two ideas are connected?
- 1.0 = Explicit connection stated
- 0.7-0.9 = Strong contextual evidence
- 0.4-0.6 = Plausible but uncertain
- 0.1-0.3 = Weak/speculative connection

**Normalization Confidence (NC)**: How certain are we different expressions represent the same idea?
- 1.0 = Identical phrasing
- 0.7-0.9 = Synonymous with minimal ambiguity
- 0.4-0.6 = Likely the same core concept
- 0.1-0.3 = Possibly related but distinct

## Protocol Structure

Process the designated **[Document Collection]** through six dimensions of conceptual extraction:

---

### I. Conceptual Primitives & Atomic Ideas

**A. Idea Decomposition:**
* Break every complex statement down to its irreducible conceptual components
* Identify the atomic ideas that cannot be further subdivided
* Strip away rhetorical decoration to expose pure conceptual content
* **Assign EC score**: Rate extraction confidence for each atomic idea (0-1)

**B. Abstraction Normalization:**
* Identify when different documents express the same idea at different levels of abstraction
* Normalize all variations to their most essential form
* Map the abstraction hierarchy from concrete instances to universal principles
* **Assign NC score**: Rate confidence that variants represent the same core idea (0-1)
* **Compound confidence**: When merging ideas, new_confidence = min(NC, avg(EC₁, EC₂))

**C. Conceptual Frequency Analysis:**
* Track how often each core concept appears across the document set
* Distinguish between repetition of the same idea vs. genuine conceptual diversity
* Identify which ideas are fundamental (appear in many contexts) vs. peripheral
* **Weight by confidence**: Frequency = Σ(occurrences × EC_score)

---

### II. Relational Architecture & Idea Networks

**A. Conceptual Dependencies:**
* Map which ideas require other ideas to exist
* Identify foundational concepts that support multiple derivative ideas
* Trace the logical flow from premises to conclusions across documents
* **Assign RC score**: Rate dependency strength (0-1)
* **Propagate confidence**: Dependent_idea_confidence = min(EC_dependent, EC_foundation × RC)

**B. Idea Clustering & Affinity Mapping:**
* Group ideas that naturally co-occur or reference each other
* Identify conceptual families and their internal relationships
* Map the distance between ideas in conceptual space
* **Cluster confidence score**: Average RC of all connections within cluster
* **Distance metric**: d = 1 - RC (higher confidence = closer in concept space)

**C. Cross-Document Synthesis:**
* Find where separate documents contribute pieces of a larger idea
* Identify complementary concepts that complete each other
* Discover emergent ideas that only appear through document intersection
* **Synthesis confidence**: SC = min(EC₁, EC₂, ...) × avg(RC_between_components)
* **Flag low-confidence syntheses** (SC < 0.5) for human review

---

### III. Conceptual Topology & Structure

**A. Dimensional Analysis:**
* What fundamental dimensions organize the idea space (time, scale, domain, etc.)?
* How do ideas distribute across these dimensions?
* Where are the dense regions and sparse regions in the conceptual field?
* **Dimension relevance score**: How strongly each idea maps to each dimension (0-1)
* **Placement confidence**: How certain we are of an idea's position in the space (0-1)

**B. Hierarchical Organization:**
* Extract the natural taxonomy of ideas from most general to most specific
* Identify parent-child relationships between concepts
* Map horizontal relationships between ideas at the same level
* **Hierarchy confidence**: HC = RC_parent_child × min(EC_parent, EC_child)
* **Taxonomy stability score**: Average HC across all relationships in a branch

**C. Boundary Conditions:**
* Where does one idea end and another begin?
* What are the edge cases that challenge clean categorization?
* Which ideas exist at the intersection of multiple categories?
* **Boundary clarity score**: 1.0 = distinct separation, 0.0 = complete overlap
* **Multi-category membership**: Assign probability distribution across categories

---

### IV. Semantic Deep Structure

**A. Core vs. Surface Variation:**
* Distinguish between fundamental conceptual differences and mere linguistic variation
* Identify when different words/phrases express identical underlying ideas
* Extract the semantic invariants that persist across different expressions
* **Semantic equivalence score**: SES (0-1) for each proposed equivalence
* **Variation confidence**: How sure we are this is stylistic vs. substantive difference

**B. Implicit Idea Extraction:**
* Surface concepts that are assumed but never explicitly stated
* Identify the conceptual negative space - what must be true for stated ideas to work
* Extract ideas embedded in examples, metaphors, or analogies
* **Inference confidence**: IC = EC_explicit × strength_of_implication
* **Mark all implicit extractions** with IC < 0.7 as "inferred"

**C. Conceptual Transforms:**
* How do ideas change as they move between documents?
* What transformations occur (generalization, specialization, combination)?
* Track conceptual evolution and mutation patterns
* **Transform confidence**: How certain we are a transformation occurred (0-1)
* **Fidelity score**: How much of the original idea survives transformation (0-1)

---

### V. Generative Patterns & Idea Dynamics

**A. Conceptual Generators:**
* Identify the "seed" ideas that spawn multiple variations
* Extract the generative rules that produce families of related concepts
* Find the algorithmic patterns in how ideas develop
* **Generator strength**: GS = num_generated × avg(RC_to_derivatives)
* **Pattern confidence**: How certain we are the pattern is real vs. coincidental (0-1)

**B. Recombination Potential:**
* Which ideas can be productively combined?
* What new concepts emerge from systematic recombination?
* Map the generative potential of the conceptual field
* **Combination viability score**: CVS = compatibility × novelty × feasibility (each 0-1)
* **Predicted success confidence**: Based on similar combinations observed

**C. Conceptual Attractors:**
* Which ideas do discussions naturally gravitate toward?
* What are the stable points in the idea space?
* Where are the unstable regions ripe for innovation?
* **Attractor strength**: Frequency of convergence × average path confidence
* **Stability score**: Resistance to perturbation/reinterpretation (0-1)

---

### VI. Meta-Conceptual Analysis

**A. Idea Space Completeness:**
* What is the total conceptual territory covered by the documents?
* Where are the obvious gaps in the idea space?
* What percentage of the possible conceptual field has been explored?
* **Coverage confidence**: How sure we are we've found all ideas (0-1)
* **Gap certainty**: Confidence that an identified gap is real vs. missed extraction

**B. Conceptual Quality Metrics:**
* Depth: How thoroughly is each idea developed? (0-1 score)
* Breadth: How much of the possible idea space is covered? (0-1 score)
* Coherence: How well do the ideas form a consistent whole? (0-1 score)
* Novelty: Which ideas represent genuine innovation? (0-1 score)
* **Meta-confidence**: Confidence in our quality assessments themselves

**C. Extraction Confidence:**
* Which ideas are clearly expressed vs. ambiguously indicated?
* Where might the extraction process have introduced distortion?
* What requires human judgment vs. systematic extraction?
* **Overall extraction confidence**: Weighted average of all EC scores
* **Distortion risk score**: Areas where confidence < 0.5 across multiple measures

## Implementation Principles

**Multi-Resolution Processing:**
* First pass: Surface-level concept identification (target avg EC > 0.8)
* Second pass: Deep structure extraction (accept EC > 0.5)
* Third pass: Relationship mapping (focus on RC > 0.6)
* Fourth pass: Pattern identification (require pattern confidence > 0.7)
* Fifth pass: Synthesis and gap analysis (flag all scores < 0.5)

**Confidence Propagation Rules:**
* Combined ideas inherit the minimum confidence of components
* Derived ideas = source confidence × derivation confidence
* Clustered ideas weighted by connection strength
* Never allow confidence to increase without new evidence

**Conceptual Hygiene:**
* One idea, one representation (eliminate redundancy)
* Maintain conceptual purity (don't mix ideas)
* Preserve nuance while seeking simplicity
* Document transformation decisions with confidence scores
* **Merge threshold**: Only combine ideas if NC > 0.8

**Output Formats:**
* **Concept Graph**: Visual network with edge weights = RC scores
* **Idea Tensor**: Multi-dimensional array with confidence as additional dimension
* **Conceptual Inventory**: Hierarchical catalog with EC scores for each entry
* **Relationship Matrix**: RC scores for all idea pairs
* **Gap Analysis**: Missing ideas with confidence of absence
* **Confidence Dashboard**: Distribution of scores across all metrics

**Human-in-the-Loop Triggers:**
* Any extraction with EC < 0.4
* Any relationship with RC < 0.3
* Any synthesis with SC < 0.5
* Conflicting high-confidence ideas (both > 0.8)
* Areas with systematic low confidence

## The Goal

Transform a messy, redundant collection of documents into a clean, normalized conceptual field where:
- Every unique idea is captured once
- Relationships are explicit
- The deep structure is visible
- New combinations become obvious
- The complete "skeleton" of thought is revealed

This is not about words or documents anymore - it's about the pure ideas that exist within them, waiting to be extracted, understood, and recombined.
